            Phil Welsh's Data Curation Exercise
        </h3>

        <p>
            I mostly chose datasets from the United States Geological Survey.
            Aside from being authoritative, trusted datasets, they are also generally
            free and without access constraints. I believe the five datasets below
            would be useful for geologists using Felt.

        </br>
        </br>

            Please click the layer names to visit their website
        </p>

            <li><h5><a href="https://mrdata.usgs.gov/ngdb/rock/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black">National Geochemical Database: Rock ➡️</a></h5></li>
                <p>
                    I chose to style this layer on the map. After running into
                    various roadblocks with Mapbox's file size limitations, I ended
                    up using Carto due to their increased file size limits, easy
                    styling, and built-in popups in iframes.
                </br>

                </br>
                    This dataset contains over 400K points containing links to geochemical
                    analyses of rock samples collected by the USGS. I believe this layer should
                    be a part of this collection because geology generally deals with the earth's
                    physical structure, and the rocks of which it is composed.

                </br>
                </br>

                    Also, the dataset covers the whole world, so this collection would not be limited to American geologists.

                </p>

            <li><h5><a href="https://mrdata.usgs.gov/major-deposits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black">Major Mineral Deposits of the World</a></h5></li>

            <p>
                This USGS dataset portrays the locations of known deposits of major
                mineral commodities. Similar to the layer above, geologists
                study minerals for research, classification, and extraction.
                Ideally this dataset would help inform their decisions and research.
            </p>

            <li><h5><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/faults" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black">Quaternary Fault and Fold Database of the United States</a></h5></li>
            <p>
                Depending on a geologist's area of research, they might require a dataset
                portraying fault lines. This dataset portrays faults and folds in the United
                States. The attribute information contains many fields including the name, age,
                slip rate, and a link to more information on the USGS website.
            </p>

            <li><h5><a href="https://mrdata.usgs.gov/ngdb/soil/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black">National Geochemical Database: Soil</a></h5></li>

            <p>
                Along with rocks, tectonic plates, and water bodies, geologists are interested
                in soil. This USGS dataset shows detailed information about different soils
                and land cover in the United States.
            </p>

            <li><h5><a href="https://mrdata.usgs.gov/nure/water/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black">Geochemistry of water samples in the US</a></h5></li>

            <p>
                This USGS dataset contains over 335K data points containing information regarding
                water samples' pH, sediment, color, and surrounding vegetation. I believe geologists
                would find this data useful.
